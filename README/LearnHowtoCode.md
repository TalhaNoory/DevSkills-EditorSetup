<!-- Don't have a clear goal? -->

2. Know exactly WHY you are learning to code: Finding a better job?
3. Imagine a big project you want to be able to build!
4. Research technologies you need and then learn them!

<!-- Copy the code without carring how it works! -->

1. Understand the code that you're studying and typing
2. Always type the code, don't copy-paste!

<!-- Reinforce -->

2. Take notes!
3. Challenge yoruself and practice with small coding exercises and challenges
4. Don't be in a hurry to complete the course fast!

<!-- Not practicing coding? -->

1. Practicing on your own is the most important thing to do
2. This is NOT optional! Without practice outside of courses, you won't go anywhere!
3. Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications, or just parts of them in the beginning
4. Don't be stuck in "tutorial hell"

<!-- Quickly becoming frustrated -->

1. Don't get stuck trying to write the perfect code!
2. Just write tons of code, no matter the quality!
3. Clean and efficient code will come with time!
4. You can always refactor code later!

<!-- Losing Motivation -->

1. Embrace the fast that you will enver know everything :O!
2. Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal!

<!-- Learning in isolation... -->

1. Explain new concepts to other people. If you can explain it, you truly understand it!
2. Share your goals to makes yourself accountable
3. Share your learning progress with the web dev community
   (#100Days of coding, #CodeNewbie, #webdec, etc)
