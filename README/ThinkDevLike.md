<!-- How to fail at solving problems! -->

<!-- THE WRONG APPROACH -->

1. Jumping to a problem without much thinking!
2. Implementing solutions in an unstructured way!
3. Getting stressed out when things don't work!
4. Too Proud to research solutions!

<!-- The CORRECT APPROACH -->

1. Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan
2. Take a very Logical and rational approach (Programming is just logic, in the end... TRUE DAT!)
3. Use the 4-step framework to solve any problem!
