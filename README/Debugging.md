<!-- What is a software bug? -->

<!-- Software bug: -->

- Defect or problem in a computer program.
  Basically, any unexpected or unintended behavior of a computer probram is a software bug.
- Bugs are completely normal in software developement!

<!-- Previous example: reverse([1,3,5,7]) -->

- We need a function that reverses whatever we pass into it

<!-- Wrong out put: [5, 1, 7, 3] -->

- Unexpected result: the array is scrambled, NOT reversed.
  So there is a bug in the reverse function!

<!-- Debugging -->
